[WIP] Less idle time for station traders in X4 Foundations

(links etc)

> Efficient logistics; that's how simple it is!

## Quick Info
TL;DR: no player action needed!

It turns out, vanilla station traders have an undocumented idle time of 1.5 to 5.5 minutes before trying to find another trade. While this is suitable for most medium-sized stations, it is clearly not suitable for tradestations where high-volume trading are expected. This long idle time often gives the false impression that tradestations simply "doesn't work"; they do really work, just very slowly.

This mod reduces the idle time for tradestation subordinate traders. You should see your tradestation perform much better as a local logistics hub.

If you have used Civilian Fleets before, this should feel similar to when you would be setting up a regional trading fleet to move wares from this side of the map to the other side of the map.

Compatible with my other trade tweak mods e.g. Fully Loaded.
